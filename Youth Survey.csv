So I’d never really had a typical going-to-school routine. It would have been an adjustment for me either way switching from complete homeschool to remote or in-person public school. Our first day of school this year was remote, so I resolved to pay attention and learn as best as I could.

It’s because my family cares about education. It’s because I care about whether or not I will be successful in life. Whenever I get a bad grade on a test, I don’t complain to my teacher, or anyone, because I know it was my own fault for not asking for help or looking for resources which could give me a better understanding of the material covered. I try to encourage my fellow students to do the same.
If you have a good work ethic, perseverance, and belief in your capabilities, you can accomplish anything. No one should be pounded with discouraging thoughts that the world is stacked against them, or they will stop trying to succeed. I know I am a strong and intelligent young woman. I’m tired of our culture telling us to succeed at one time but at another time sending us messages that the world is stacked against us. Because it is not. Right now, there is no doubt in my mind that I could start a business, govern a state, or become the president of the United States. I know I and other girls like me can succeed. Don’t let our world make us doubt that.","","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The school did give students the latest Apple iPads to use at home, which has been really helpful in many situations!","One week or less","I had actually been homeschooled up until ninth grade, and then I went to take a few core classes at the public school my freshman year. So I’d never really had a typical going-to-school routine. It would have been an adjustment for me either way switching from complete homeschool to remote or in-person public school. Our first day of school this year was remote, so I resolved to pay attention and learn as best as I could. Of course, I had a bit of a headache the first few days from an overdose on screen time, but my eyes adapted quickly. It really wasn’t that bad for me.","2","I didn't use this","I didn't use this","I didn't use this","2","I didn't use this","I didn't use this","I didn't use this","I didn't use this","5 (Very familiar)","4","5 (Very familiar)","4","5 (Very familiar)","5 (Very familiar)","5 (Very familiar)","5 (Very familiar)","Not really. Just the occasional interruption to internet connection.","It was hard not being able to do my chemistry experiments in class with my teacher.","Why have I had so few problems adjusting to a different form of education? It’s because my family cares about education. It’s because I care about whether or not I will be successful in life. Whenever I get a bad grade on a test, I don’t complain to my teacher, or anyone, because I know it was my own fault for not asking for help or looking for resources which could give me a better understanding of the material covered. I try to encourage my fellow students to do the same.
If you have a good work ethic, perseverance, and belief in your capabilities, you can accomplish anything. No one should be pounded with discouraging thoughts that the world is stacked against them, or they will stop trying to succeed. I know I am a strong and intelligent young woman. I’m tired of our culture telling us to succeed at one time but at another time sending us messages that the world is stacked against us. Because it is not. Right now, there is no doubt in my mind that I could start a business, govern a state, or become the president of the United States. I know I and other girls like me can succeed. Don’t let our world make us doubt that.","","Yes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
